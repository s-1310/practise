        <p>
            well,html seems to  be very easy to understand.
            The syntax is easy and we just need an editor to run the files.
            The information to be shared is written within the tags < > ,
            so the structure of html file contains open tag and closed tag 
            i.e <body></body> respectively.
        </p>
    </body>
